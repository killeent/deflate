/**
 * A bitstream is a abstraction layer for bit IO. It allows you to read/write
 * individual bits from/to a file.
 *
 * Because reading and writing from IO has byte-level granularity, a 
 * bitstream works by reading or writing a byte at a time and storing the 
 * individual bits in a buffer.
 * 
 * For example, if we want to read bit-by-bit from a file, we read a whole
 * byte into a buffer and then return the bits one by one. Only once the 
 * bit_count reaches zero do we need to internally read another byte into
 * the buffer.
 *
 * Similarly, if we want to write bit-by-bit to a file, we buffer 8 bits
 * at a time before writing them to the file.
